> Displays the size of a given file in your repository.


`badge-size` allows you to display in real time the size of a given file which lives in your repository.
The size is always the one of your last pushed commit.

It is mainly designed for front-end library authors that want to advertise the weight of
their builds to their users. But you can use it for any other purpose of course :v:.


## Examples

 Badge       | URL
:------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
Normal size  | https://badge-size.herokuapp.com/ngryman/badge-size/master/index.js.svg
Gzipped size | https://badge-size.herokuapp.com/ngryman/badge-size/master/index.js.svg?compression=gzip
Custom label | https://badge-size.herokuapp.com/ngryman/badge-size/master/index.js.svg?label=As tiny as
PNG format   | https://badge-size.herokuapp.com/ngryman/badge-size/master/index.js.png
JPG format   | https://badge-size.herokuapp.com/ngryman/badge-size/master/index.js.jpg


## Usage

It works like any other badge service you may know and it's configurable in the image url itself.
Here is the general pattern of a typical `badge-size` url:

```
https://img.badgesize.io/:filepath[.svg|png|jpg][?compression=gzip][&label=string]
```

#### `:filepath`

It's the url of your file on `github` when you browse it in the source explorer, minus `blob/` part.
Here is its typical form:

```md
:user/:repo/:branch/:path
```

For example if I want to point to this repository `index.js`, it would be:

`https://github.com/`**`ngryman/badge-size/master/index.js`**

Note that the branch name mandatory.

#### `[.svg|png|jpg]`

Optional image format. By default `svg` is used.

#### `[?compression=gzip]`

Optional compression format to measure. It's useful if you want to advertise the *true* size your
file would take on the wire, assuming the server has `gzip` compression enabled.

#### `[&label=string]`

Optional text to display in the badge instead of *size* / *gzip size*.
